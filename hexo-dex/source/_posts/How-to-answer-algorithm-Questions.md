### Interviewer Conditions

Coding Interview is going to select a perfect matched programer to work together. Hence, interviwers will assume that interviewees have already has coding experience and focus on communication skill and working style.

### Questions

Normally, interviewers will ask project related questions such as Binary Search Serialization or Deserilization, mutiple threads, timing LRU, and so on. If interviewees are not familier with these questions, interviewers will try to find advatages of these interviewees by asking open questions or hard coding questions. 

### Communication

Interviewers will check communication skill by ask coding questions. They want interviewees ask some questions before typing code because real tasks are not the same as coding questions. It is easier to cause mistakes by ignoring inconspicuous changes. 

You can follow below steps to answer algorithm questions:

**Before** 

*	Ask Questions to document your assumptions. (Limitation, Value Type, Focus on Space or Time)
*	Briefly Explain your approach or solution to show how you intend to solve the problem. (2 or 3 sentences)

>When you make some assutions, the interviewers may ask you change your assumptions. They want to see your reaction to meet unknow questions.For example, if you assume time cost is higher priority, they may ask you to assume sapce cost is hither priorty. 

**Coding**

*	Provide code comments where applicable. (the # of parameters of a method are over 3, that should write comment);

>Bug Free and complete on time.

**After**

*	Explain the big-O run time complexity of your solution. Justify your answer.
*	Identify and additional data structures you used and justify why you used them. (Why do you use this structure? Is that necessary?).
*	Only provide your best answer to each part of the question.

>Then, you could run some corner cases to check code logic. Next, interviwers will ask follow-up questions in order to check your knowledge and patience.
