"While I would be very willing to let the website send a bottle of wine based on my preferences, I usually want a specific type of wine for a specific type of thing (white wine for cooking, or a special type of wine to pair with food) so I think it would be best if I picked myself"
"When it comes to shopping, I am not a risk taker. I like what I like and I'll spend my money knowing I'm going to get what I want."
What if I don't like the unknown bottle of wine? I prefer something that I have already tasted.
THE FLAVOR
Since I don't know the retailer I prefer to choose the wine myself so I can get he kind of wine I like.
Seems a better option
Product A means I chose the bottle myself.  In making that decision I know that I will enjoy the type of wine I have purchased because I know what I prefer.
none
Like to pick out my own wine.
Just want to make sure I get what I want and if I'm not happy with it it will be more my fault and not because of someone else's choice.
Its good and nice
"It's already difficult enough based on my lack of understanding in regards to the retailer.  I think I would be in a state of confusion and would want to have some certainty.  Thus, I would do my own research and choose a bottle myself."
It seems like the better choice in general.
It is very useful one so i select it
If I know the products well on the website then I would feel more confident choosing one of their options considering I probably know it.
If I go online to choose a bottle it means I have drank that brand before and know what I am buying is something that I like.
"I'm picky. But I also like being surprised every now and again. I chose product A as I'd know exactly what I'm getting and in these trying times (COVID pandemic) I like the surety of things more than ever. I'd only pick product B if I wanted a bit of spontaneity in my life. And right now, I don't."
"I'm not sure what I am even getting with Product B, or how well the company even would know what I like without more data being given to me. Option A would be a safer choice, because I know what I like in wine."
I'm not sure if I would be getting my money's worth with option B and I would also just rather choose for myself.
"I'm not going to buy something random without knowing what it is, even if the seller knows my preferences. I want control over what I'm spending money on."
"I'm not familiar with this retailer and have no idea how the retailer would be able to send me a good bottle of wine based on my preferences. I'd rather have a bottle of wine that I chose myself since at least I know my own wine preferences, even if I'm not particularly familiar with the store."
"I'm big on labels on wine, and often choose the wine based on the label. I would want to know I get what I like!"
I'd rather pick something for myself.
I'd rather make the decision myself instead of having someone else make the choice for me
I'd rather have something I know I'd like than risk getting something I wouldn't.
"I'd rather choose something I'd like for sure than rely on someone else to choose for me. This is because the recommendation of product B might not be what I want and that's not a risk I'm willing to take. Therefore, I'd much prefer to just choose myself."
I wouldn't feel comfortable allowing the company to choose for me because I'm not familiar with them and they don't know my preferences.
I would want to pick the wine myself since I do not think that the company would be able to decide what is best for me since they would not know the occasion and my preferences and desires.
I would want to order something that I know that I like rather than take a chance of getting something I will not like
I would want to know what I am buying when I am buying it. I trust myself more than a mystery purchase.
I would rely on my own decisions instead of being surprised with something that I really know I wouldn't enjoy despite it matching my preferences.
I would rather pick something myself to be sure I Get something I want.
"I would rather not take the risk of being sent a product through Option B that I wouldn't know firsthand. I would rather do my own research, even if it meant paying premium price, to ensure that I was happy with my choice. Option A appeals a lot more to me by being able to control what product I choose."
I would rather make the decision and be responsible for enjoying/disliking a bottle of wine than handing the responsibility off to someone I have never even met.
I would rather make my own decisions unless I want to be surprised.
I would rather make my own decision and choice for finding a wine.
I would rather make my own choices than have someone think they know what is best for me.
I would rather have some feeling of control over my purchase.
"I would rather have control over what wine I receive. I don't trust algorithms to figure out my taste, they rarely work for other things."
I would rather choose what I want based on the occasion then to have the company send me a random bottle that I may not even like.
I would rather choose what I like. I want the control.
"I would rather choose the product I will receive at a greater chance of being satisfied with it, than the chance of not being satisfied with the option that the retailer has selected for me."
i would rather choose myself
I would rather choose a bottle of wine myself rather than have a random bottle sent to me. I would do research on the wine if needed.
I would rather be involved in the decision than not. It will be partly my fault if I don't like it.
I would probably not like what they sent me and then I would regret my decision
I would prefer to select my own product
"I would prefer to know exactly what I was receiving, and be able to choose the option I like the best.  I would be mad if I received something I didn't like from option B."
"I would prefer picking one myself, if after tasting and I don't like it, I'd blame myself rather than having to blame someone else."
I would much rather get something I know I will like than to pay for possibly something that I won't like.
I would like to pick out what i want to have.
I would like to get a bottle of wine that I am sure I would like. If I can see the wine I will know what kind of wine it is at the very least.
"I would like to choose, I donâ€™t like being surprised.  I also donâ€™t drink wine."
"I would like to choose what I want, It is important I choose it myself"
I would like to choose myself because I like to have more control over what I am getting. I would be afraid that If I picked option B I might get something that I do not like and blame the company. If I pick myself then there is nobody to blame but myself.
I would like to choose my favorite when it comes to wine. I don't like to receive a random one.
"I would be in control of what I selected. If I chose Option B, I would be at the mercy of the retailer and not completely trust the process. I would be worried the retailer would choose wine that they had a large stock of and wanted to get rid of while with Option A, I know I could choose a reliable product."
I would be certain to get a bottle of wine I like
I was familiar with the products and would prefer to choose and know what I was going to get.
I wanted to pick it out myself so I am sure to like it.
"I wanted to be in control of what I wanted and didn't want to be unfamiliare with what I would be sent, so I chose A."
I want to make sure when I am purchasing something a bit expensive that I am getting something I like. I don't want to take a chance they send me a bottle and I won't like it.
I want to make sure the wine is of my preference.
I want to know what I'm getting. I don't want to risk getting something I may not like.
I want to know what I am buying
I want to know exactly what I'm getting.
I want to have some type of expectaion on something i dont know
I want to buy the products based on my own decisions.
I want to be sure that the wine I get is something I would actually want and enjoy and not leaving it to chanve.
I want to be able to make a choice. Just because I am knowledgeable about a retailer does not mean I give them free reign to make my shopping decisions.
I want the freedom to be able to choose the wine for myself
"I want something distinct and at least I can expect. Unknown is good for probably gifts or surprises, but I am not surprising myself for something I will buy."
I usually like what I pick so I want to pick my own
I usually like to pick something I know I will like. I feel more confident I would like it if I choose it myself.
I usually drink a specific type of wine. Russian River Valley Pinot Noir. If it is not Russian River Valley then I usually will not finish the bottle.
I think that I would be more satisfied if I chose product A because of the fact that I can choose the wine myself instead of having it being picked for me because I might not like it (unless it was at a lower than normal price).
I think it would be better for me to research a few different offerings on the site myself.
I think I would prefer to only have myself to blame if I didn't like the wine.
I think I know enough about the retailer and its products to make the best decision for myself
I think I can choose a wine that interests me greatly whereas in option B I might be disappointed if I open the box and see a wine I would not purchase.
I think even though I do not know much about the bottle of wine I would want to choose it myself. I think it would be interesting and I would like to try something different once in a while.
"I tend to go with the tried-and-true product for the most part. If I actually spoke with someone I knew and described what I wanted, and they were knowledgeable, I might be willing to try something different, but honestly, these days, there's just too much change going on - I like stability and predictability anywhere I can find it - even in a bottle of wine."
I strongly prefer to choose my own products because I feel I can make a better choice and I like have control over those decisions. I really enjoy finding the products myself and learning about the products while I find new products. I feel I would make a better and more informative decision rather than having someone else select a bottle of wine for me. I am worried that if I let someone else pick for me that they may choose something I don't like.
I still know my preference and the occassion more intricately than the retailer.
"I simply don't like others making choices for me. Even if I use the site alot, I know at the time what I am wanting."
I prefer to select choice myself.
"I prefer to make my own choices, especially since I know nothing about the retailer."
"I prefer to evaluate my choices based on factors I find important. Given that the options were the same costs, I would rather evaluate my choices and take responsibility if I made a poor choice."
"I prefer to choose what i want when spending money and not be surprised, because i might not like it and already spent the money on it"
I prefer option A because I like to make my own choices and decision. In other words I'm taking charge of my future or destiny by making my own personal choices. I don't think the wine retailer will send me a good bottle of wine base on my preferences.
i only like 2 kinds of wine so i may get something i dont like if i chose B
I made the decision based on my feelings and emotions.
I like to pick my own wines.
"I like to know what I am paying for, than having someone else pick for me.... I may end up feeling terrible if the choice isn't what I want"
i like this very much
I like the product. i like the benefits and features of it. it seems more superior and appeals to me the most
I like product A because I can actually choose what I get.
I like making choices on my own.
"I like a small number of wines, but purchase them often.  It is unlikely the wine chosen by retailer would be one that I like"
I know what the product would be and know exactly when I would get it
"I know what sort of wines I like, and I know what sort of wine I might like at the particular point in time when the order is being placed.  The retailer may have a general idea of my preferences based on previous orders, but might send me something I totally do not like.  Prefer not to take that risk."
I know what kind of wine I like so I'd rather see them myself and choose on my own.
I know what I like in wines and don't want someone else choosing what I will drink.
I know what I like and I don't want to risk getting something I don't like and wasting my money.
"I know that I'll like what I select, but I cannot. be so sure if the retailer selects"
i know my preference better than some algorithm
I know my own preferences with 100% certainty.
"I know a bunch about wine, so would prefer to choose myself. I might try having them choose once just for fun or to see if it is worth it, but I know what I like and trust myself more."
I just want what I pick. I understand the retailer may do a good job of what they choose but I don't like that. I want to know what I am getting exactly.
I have more confidence in my choice than a surprise
I get to choose my product.
I felt the option was somewhat appealing and reasonable for me to choose myself what I desire and want.
"I feel more comfortable being able to be in control and make my own decisions. Even though I am unfamiliar with the store and its products, I feel safer this way."
I feel like I would rather not want to take a risk and choose my own wine instead.
"I feel like I would know what I like and probably would choose a bottle of wine that I have purchased before. If I did not like the wine, I would feel it was my own fault. I think I would rather take the responsibility of picking our what I think I would like."
"I enjoy browsing and comparing, prior to spending. I would never take the chance on paying for a ""surprise"" package."
I don't want to pay for a bottle of wine that I might not like. I prefer to know what I am getting and exactly what I am buying.
I don't know what I want so I'm not sure how to describe it to the company
"I don't know enough about this retailer, and they certainly don't know enough about me, to let them choose a bottle of wine for me.  Unless I wanted to be adventurous for the sake of being adventurous, I'd want to have control over the decision and make it myself.  I just don't have any idea whether they'll make a good and pertinent choice or not."
I don't know enough about the retailer to feel comfortable depending on their choices
I do not want to be sent a cheaper bottle of wine that I have no control over.
"I chose product A because if I'm familiar with this website, I'd know what kind of wine I'd want to choose. I wouldn't just want some random bottle sent to me even if it is based on my preferences."
I chose A because i saw what it looked like on the website compared to B I don't have any idea what it looks like.
"I chose A because I feel more comfortable knowing what wine I will be receiving. I am worried that if I choose B, I might not like the wine I receive."
I can choose it myself. I prefer to make my own choices.
I came decision because I want to pick what wine I want.
I am very specific when I pick things out for myself.
I am very particular about wines.
"I am familiar with the website and their products, so I am very comfortable making my own purchasing decisions. I don't want a random bottle of wine sent to me."
i am able to take what i like. I am not blind as to what i will get in case of B
I am able to read reviews and review the product myself instead of relying on a random bottle.
I am a huge fan of being able to make my own choices and not have others do it for me.
"I am a control freak who wants to know exactly what they are spending their money on. Also, I don't like all types of wine."
I always like to choose my own products rather than let someone else decide for me.
i always believe i can make the right choice for myself even though i do not have alot of experience about it
Even though chosing product b could be beneficial I trust my own instincts better.
"even if i'm not familiar with the exact wines sold here, i have an idea of the kinds of wines i like. i dont like a lot of types of wines and do not want to be surprised. if i must get a random bottle of wine, i can always gift it. but if it's for me, i want the control of choosing it for myself."
"Doesn't make sense to me to purchase something random. If I didn't like it, I'd really feel like I wasted my money. Too much risk for no reason when the option to make your own decision is available."
choice
BOTTLE OF WINE IS VERY TASTY AND GOOD PRODUCT
Because it is very important I personally chose my wine
