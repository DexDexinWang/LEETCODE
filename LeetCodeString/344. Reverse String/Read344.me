Time Complexity: `O(n)` (Average Case) and `O(n)` (Worst Case) where `n` is the total number character in the input string. The algorithm need to reverse the whole string.
Auxiliary Space: `O(n)` space is used where `n` is the total number character in the input string. Space is needed to transform string to character array.


Approach: Iterative Swapping Using Two Pointers
One pointer is pointing at the start of the string while the other pointer is pointing at the end of the string. Both pointers will keep swapping its element and travel towards each other. The algorithm basically simulating rotation of a string with respect to its midpoint.
