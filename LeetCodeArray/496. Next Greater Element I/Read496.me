Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array. 
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array.

Consideration:
1. The brute force can work it as O(n^2).
2. The non-duplication is a smart condition to reduce the time complexity.
3. I just consider whether to search all first greater number of its right in O(n) and stores result into HashMap for searching.
4. Base on the value of findnums to search hashmap with O(n).
