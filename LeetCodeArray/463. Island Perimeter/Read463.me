
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of grids.

Consideration:
1. When I find an island, I will add 4 to the total perimeter.
2. Check the top and below positions whether there is an island. If yes, total perimeter mins 2. 

Consideration:
1. Consider DFS solution. You could find an island and check its surrounded islands recursively.
