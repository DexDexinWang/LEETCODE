Time Complexity: O(n)

Consideration:
1. Since this is a BST, the inorder traversal of its nodes results in a sorted list of values. Thus, the minimum absolute difference must occur in any adjacently traversed nodes. I use the global variable "prev" to keep track of each node's inorder predecessor.
