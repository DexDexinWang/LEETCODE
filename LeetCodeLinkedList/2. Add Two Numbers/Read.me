Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the longest linked list.
Space Complexity: O(n) = O(2n) where n is the length of the longest linked list.

Consideration:
1. The length of both linked lists maybe different. 
2. The linked lists may be null. 
3. The length of result linked list may be longer then both because of carry.
4. Consider next nodes of both current nodes will be empty.
